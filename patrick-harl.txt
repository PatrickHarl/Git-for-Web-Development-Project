    It allows you to select all elements of the type to the right of the selector who is a direct child to the element on the left of the selector.
    Thus div > p is much more specific then div p. div > p allows you to check for direct parent child relationship, as opposed to div p which will 
    select all <p> that have a <div> parent at any point back in the tree. This is useful when you are looking for a specific and direct parent child 
    relationship between two elements to then decide to apply your CSS to.

Stretch Questions

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?

    Use display:inline-block;

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block: <div> <p> <h1>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

    The box model is an approach that considers all HTML elements to be boxes with attributes such as padding, margins, borders, etc. that all content is then placed into. 
    The boxes are then used to style and organize the layout of the page.

    The fix for the box model is the flexbox model.
